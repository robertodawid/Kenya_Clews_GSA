# Sectoral interactions and primary drivers in integrated CLEWs modeling: Insights from Kenya
This repository contains the workflow used to conduct a Global Sensitivity Analysis on an Energy System Optimization model (ESOMs) developed in OSeMOSYS [^1]. The model was developed using the Climate Land Energy Water Systems (CLEWs) [^2] framework.

# Create a new environment in Conda
The attached _*.yml_ will allow you to create a new environment in Conda. The new environment has been tested and is working on Windows.  
```
conda env create -f env.yml
```
